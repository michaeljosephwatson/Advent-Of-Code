### Advent of Code 2025

I thought it would be fun to do Advent of Code this year and thought it would be nice to upload them here.

There are 12 problems this year. 

My aim is to improve my problem solving skills and come up with some nice solutions by myself.

The problems can be found here [link](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

Full credit and gratitude goes to the team behind this fun festive activity.
